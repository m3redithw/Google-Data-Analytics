One analyst copies a large dataset to check the dates. But because of memory issues, only part of the dataset is actually copied. The analyst would be verifying and standardizing incomplete data. That partial dataset would be certified as compliant but the full dataset would still contain dates that weren't verified. Two versions of a dataset can introduce inconsistent results. A final audit of results would be essential to reveal what happened and correct all dates. "

As sample size increases, the results more closely resemble the normal (bell-shaped) distribution from a large number of samples. A sample of 30 is the smallest sample size for which the CLT is still valid. Researchers who rely on regression analysis – statistical methods to determine the relationships between controlled and dependent variables – also prefer a minimum sample of 30.\n",
