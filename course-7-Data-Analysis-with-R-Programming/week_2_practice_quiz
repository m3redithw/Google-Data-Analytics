Test your knowledge on programming concepts

Question 1
Why do analysts use comments In R programming? Select all that apply.

# To make an R Script more readable
# To explain their code


Question 2
What should you use to assign a value to a variable in R?

# An operator

// You should use an operator to assign a value to a variable in R. You should use operators such as <- after a variable to assign a value to it.


Question 3
Which of the following examples is the proper syntax for a function in R?

# print()

// An example of the syntax for a function in R is print(). If you add an argument in the parentheses for the print() function, the argument will appear in the console pane of RStudio.


Question 4
Which of the following examples can you use in R for date/time data? Select all that apply.

# 2019-04-16
# 2018-12-21 16:35:28 UTC
# 06:11:13 UTC

// The examples of types of date/time data that you can use in R are 06:11:13 UTC, 2019-04-16, and 2018-12-21 16:35:28 UTC. R recognizes the syntax of each of these formats as a date/time data type.

Hands-On Activity: R sandbox

Which function can you use to create a different plot for each type of cut of diamond?

# facet_wrap()

// facet_wrap() is an R function used to create subplots, which are individual plots that represent a specific part of a broader dataset. In upcoming activities, you will learn more functions that are helpful while programming in R.

Test your knowledge on coding in R

Question 1
An analyst includes the following calculation in their R programming:
midyear_sales <- (quarter_1_sales + quarter_2_sales) - overhead_costs
Which variable will the total from this calculation be assigned to?

# midyear_sales

// The total from this calculation will be assigned to the variable midyear_sales. The assignment operator <- follows the variable mid_sales, so the value of the calculated total is assigned to this variable.


Question 2
An analyst is checking the value of the variable x using a logical operator, so they run the following code:
 x > 35 & x < 65
Which values of x would return TRUE when the analyst runs the code? Select all that apply.

# 50
# 60


Question 3
A data analyst inputs the following code in RStudio:
sales_1 <- 100 * sales_2
Which of the following types of operators does the analyst use in the code? Select all the apply.

# arithmetic 
# assignment 

// The analyst uses assignment and arithmetic operators in the code. The assignment operator (<-) assigns the variable sales_1 to the value of 100 * sales_2. The multiplication operator (*) multiplies 100 by sales_2.

Test your knowledge on R packages

Question 1
When using RStudio, what does the installed.packages() function do?

# Presents a list of packages currently installed in an RStudio session


Question 2
In data analytics, what is CRAN?

# A commonly used online archive with R packages and other R resources


Question 3
What are ggplot2, tidyr, dplyr, and forcats all a part of?

# A collection of core tidyverse packages

// The packages ggplot2, tidyr, dplyr, and forcats are part of a collection of eight core tidyverse packages. The other core packages are: tibble, readr, purrr, and stringr.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Test your knowledge on the tidyverse

Question 1
When working in R, for which part of the data analysis process do analysts use the tidyr package?

# Data cleaning

// Analysts use the tidyr package for data cleaning. It works with wide and long data to make sure every part of a data table or data frame is the right data type and in the right place.


Question 2
Which tidyverse package contains a set of functions, such as select(), that help with data manipulation?

# dplyr

// The dplyr package is the tidyverse package which contains a set of functions, such as select(), that help with data manipulation. For example, select() selects only relevant variables based on their names.


Question 3
An analyst is organizing a dataset in RStudio using the following code:
arrange(filter(Storage_1, inventory >= 40), count)
Which of the following examples is a nested function in the code?

# filter

// In the analyst's code, filter is the nested function. It is embedded in the argument of the broader arrange function.
